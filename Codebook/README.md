This folder contains two folders, Labelled and UnLabelled, which contains the ads that we tagged. There were two coders at all times. For each country, there are two files, each corresponding to coder 1 and 2, respectively. Each file contains 150 ads that we tagged
Each csv has 5 columns: video link, primary tag, secondar tag, rating, and description. Video link column contains the youtube links of the ads tagged for that country. Primary tag represents the main tag given to that video from 4 primary tags: child directed, irrelevant, inappropriate, and inaudible. Secondary tag were further, slighty more specific tags given to each primary tag. A detailed codebook was made before tagging, as a rubric to be used by each coder. the rating tag was only used when the primary tag was inappropriate. This represented the intensity of inappropriateness: mild, moderate, or extreme. Lastly, the description colum is a short descrition/summary of the specific ad given by the coder.
